App Requirements: 
- See which Anime films are screening 4 weeks in advance
- Need to know the name of the film, theatre, and date

Where can we find the: 
- Names of the films?
- Theatres
- Dates

Features:
- Flag new films; regardless of if they have showtimes, eliminates the need for the user to search a specific film
- Dashboard format might be helpful 

Build a tool and release on PyPi
Could build a query tool to take number of films you'd like to search

### Looking at Films (https://www.cineplex.com/api/v1/movies?language=en-us&marketLanguageCodeFilter=true&movieType=1&showTimeType=0&showtimeStatus=0&skip=0&take=1000)

- Need to use `isEvent`, this will tell us if it's an anime film

#### Finding showtimes

Very important to consider the url below:

https://www.cineplex.com/api/v1/showtimes?locationId=7130&filmId=33726&date=2022-09-09&language=en-us

- Can also see one date at a time, for one for movie, for one theatre
- This means that you'll have to send multiple request to get a summary of all the theatres and all the showtimes available for a given film!
- Showtimes might be posted last minute, example 3 days lead-in time

As an aside, I might get a chance to revisit my API writing projects from June 2022. Deploy flask app on website, serve up on a localserver so Darwin can access
Nice-to-have 
Or clone from github repo 

Appears that Cineplex is pulling from a production API rather than the ones we found on someone's GitHub

For looking showtimes for a film
``` html
https://apis.cineplex.com/prod/cpx/theatrical/api/v1/showtimes?language=en&locationId=7130&date=9/11/2022&filmId=34436
```

Front-end for the film above: 
``` html
https://www.cineplex.com/movie/ax-cinema-nights-presents-the-house-of-the-lost-on-the-cape-japanese-west
```

For list of major release movies (assump.)
``` html
https://apis.cineplex.com/prod/cpx/theatrical/api/v1/movies?language=en-us&skip=11&take=12
```

For special event movie:
``` html
https://apis.cineplex.com/prod/cpx/theatrical/api/v1/events?language=en-us&skip=11&take=12
```

Unblocked issue: To send request to their prod API, we required an `ocp apim subscription key`
https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#custom-headers

This is how we unblocked:
- Still using requests python library
``` python
import requests

url = 'https://apis.cineplex.com/prod/cpx/theatrical/api/v1/showtimes?'
headers = {'ocp-apim-subscription-key': 'dcdac5601d864addbc2675a2e96cb1f8'}

r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

r 
```

- The code above should return 200 if successful
- Much easier than executing curl commands
